CONFIG:
Copy file config.ini.sample and rename duplicate to config.ini
Inside config file, fill out email and password, and if you want to test on your own server, change channels.

INSTALLATION:
If you're using virtualenv (you should) create it in subfolder .venv (it's gitignored).
To install (should take care of dependencies):
    python setup.py develop

DEVELOPMENT:
To add new commands, you'll need to edit two places: "class Commands" and "def on_message"

Commands is a helper class, that keeps all available commands. Why is that important? Because it helps you not to worry about !help command!
Just add new command to it with code like
    foo = Command('!foo', '!foo *bar*')
First parameter is command user has to type, and second one (optional) will show up instead of the command when !help is printed.

on_message is the place where you'll be adding new stuff.
